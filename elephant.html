                <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals. 
                   Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. 
                   They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.</p>
                <p>The African bush elephant, also known as the African savanna elephant, 
                    is a species of elephant native to sub-Saharan Africa. 
                    It is one of three extant elephant species and, along with the African forest elephant, one of two extant species of African elephant.</p>
                <h4>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h4>
                <p>Find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
